Advanced Robot Cleaner

Introduction: I plan to build a robot that can identify the obstacles that the ultrasonic sensors can't and make the robot more futuristic.

Project developer- Devi Anjana Anoop S

Project: hardware project

Project description: a fully functional robot that will not get stuck in between the shelves and will identify the space left under shelves and clean the area.

Problem: I have a robot cleaner at home as there are many shelves the robot gets stuck in between the gaps and it requires human help to move. 

How I solved this issue:
 
-Technology support:
       - Arduino IDE 2.3.4

- Components used for this project :
gear motor-2x
Lithium-ion batteries
Arduino uno rev3
Motor driver-L298N
Ultrasonic sensor
Servos -2x
Limit  switch-2x
Jumper wires
Breadboard
cardboard

SOLUTION

- Here in the Arduino, the 3v and gnd are to ultrasonic-vcc and gnd, the second gnd and vin are connected to the breadboard 5v, and ultrasonic trig and echo are connected to Arduinoâ€™s, the rest half the wires are connected to a pushbutton switch. the pushbutton switch is used as the ultrasonic can only identify the area where it hits and comes so ultrasonic sensors won't be able to identify the rest areas here we include a pushbutton when it hits a shelf corner it will step back and with the help of servo it cleans the under area.
